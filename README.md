# SBB Random Train Telegram Bot

This Bot allows you to get random train connections in the Swiss Train Network (SBB). 

## The project is live on [https://t.me/sbbrandombot](https://t.me/sbbrandombot)

You activate it by sending it your current location. 
It will send you back a train station and platform.
The bot will calculate journeys as you go, and tell you when to leave and on which train to go to.
You can continue by typing `/continue`
